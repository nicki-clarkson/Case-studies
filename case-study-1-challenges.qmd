# **Case study 1: Challenges to Open Access** {#sec-cs1challenges}

**Copyright and Intellectual Property:**

-   Many historical documents and photographs were held in private collections or by local historical societies, requiring complex copyright clearance.

-   Oral history recordings involved informed consent issues and potential restrictions on public access to sensitive personal information.

-   3D reconstructions required attribution to the software used, and the photogrammetry models could contain elements of intellectual property.

**Technical Infrastructure and Sustainability:**

-   Hosting high-resolution images, 3D models, and interactive elements required significant server space and bandwidth.

-   Ensuring long-term accessibility of digital content in rapidly evolving technological environments was a concern.

-   The software used to create the 3D models might become obsolete.

**Data Management and Metadata:**

-   Creating consistent and comprehensive metadata for diverse digital objects was time-consuming and required specialised knowledge.

-   Ensuring interoperability with existing digital archives and repositories was crucial for discoverability.

**Accessibility and Usability:**

-   Designing an accessible online exhibition for users with disabilities required careful consideration of web accessibility guidelines (WCAG).

-   Translating the exhibition content into multiple languages to reach a wider audience was a desired but resource-intensive goal.

**Ethical Considerations:**

-   The representation of the former workers, and the impact of the industry on the local environment, needed to be handled with sensitivity.

-   The potential for misinterpretation or misuse of historical data was a concern.
