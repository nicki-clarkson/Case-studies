## Case studies for open access to under-represented outputs

These case studies are examples used by the University of Southampton Open Research & Publication Practice team to accompany our "Open access for diverse research outputsâ€‹" session.

The case studies are fictional, and are based on scenarios generated by Microsoft Copilot.

Please contact us at eprints\@soton.ac.uk if you have any questions or comments.
