# **Case study 1:** Suggestions for Overcoming Challenges {#sec-cs1suggestions}

**Overall considerations:**

-   Plan from the beginning of your project how you could make the research outputs as open as possible, and as closed as necessary for the long-term. What research outputs are you intending to produce? Have open conversations with your co-creators and document your agreed decisions.

**Ethics, Copyright and Intellectual Property:**

-   Consider from the outset how others could build upon your work. Develop clear guidelines for data use and reuse.

-   Prioritise securing open access licenses (e.g. [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/)) for digital content. Are [other licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses) more appropriate for software?

-   Negotiate agreements with rights holders for non-commercial open access use.

-   Ensure that consent forms for oral histories are robust and cover all potential uses of the data. Is it appropriate to share the recordings or transcripts?

**Technical Infrastructure and Sustainability:**

-   Use institutional repositories or open access platforms for long-term storage, access and preservation. Talk to you supervisor and your library for guidance at an early stage in your planning.

-   Adopt open source software and file formats to minimise dependency on proprietary technologies.

-   Develop a sustainability plan that includes regular data backups, format migration, and ongoing maintenance.

**Data Management, Metadata, Accessibility and Usability:**

-   Develop a comprehensive data management plan that outlines metadata creation, storage, and preservation procedures.

-   Ensure the metadata provides all the context required for users to understand and contextualise your data.
