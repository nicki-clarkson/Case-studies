    "text": "Case study 1: Suggestions for Overcoming Challenges\nOverall considerations:\n\nPlan from the beginning of your project how you could make the research outputs as open as possible, and as closed as necessary for the long-term. What research outputs are you intending to produce? Have open conversations with your co-creators and document your agreed decisions.\n\nEthics, Copyright and Intellectual Property:\n\nConsider from the outset how others could build upon your work. Develop clear guidelines for data use and reuse.\nPrioritise securing open access licenses (e.g. Creative Commons) for digital content. Are other licenses more appropriate for software?\nNegotiate agreements with rights holders for non-commercial open access use.\nEnsure that consent forms for oral histories are robust and cover all potential uses of the data. Is it appropriate to share the recordings or transcripts?\n\nTechnical Infrastructure and Sustainability:\n\nUse institutional repositories or open access platforms for long-term storage, access and preservation. Talk to you supervisor and your library for guidance at an early stage in your planning.\nAdopt open source software and file formats to minimise dependency on proprietary technologies.\nDevelop a sustainability plan that includes regular data backups, format migration, and ongoing maintenance.\n\nData Management, Metadata, Accessibility and Usability:\n\nDevelop a comprehensive data management plan that outlines metadata creation, storage, and preservation procedures.\nEnsure the metadata provides all the context required for users to understand and contextualise your data.\n\nNext section: Case study 2",

This exhibition aims to showcase the rich textile heritage of a specific region, highlighting the historical and cultural significance of the textile industry, focusing on the social and technological changes it underwent over two centuries.\nExhibition Components:\n\nDigital Archive: A collection of high-resolution photographs of textile samples, historical documents (factory records, personal letters), and oral history recordings of former textile workers.\n3D Reconstructions: Virtual models of historical textile machinery and factory interiors, created using photogrammetry and CAD software.\nInteractive Timeline: A digital timeline allowing users to explore the evolution of the industry through interactive maps, data visualizations, and multimedia content.\nOnline Exhibition Catalogue: A detailed catalogue with scholarly essays, object descriptions, and contextual information.\nVirtual Tour: A 360-degree virtual tour of the physical exhibition space, allowing remote access.\n\nNext section: Case study 1: challenges to open access",

    "text": "Case study 1: Challenges to Open Access\nCopyright and Intellectual Property:\n\nMany historical documents and photographs were held in private collections or by local historical societies, requiring complex copyright clearance.\nOral history recordings involved informed consent issues and potential restrictions on public access to sensitive personal information.\n3D reconstructions required attribution to the software used, and the photogrammetry models could contain elements of intellectual property.\n\nTechnical Infrastructure and Sustainability:\n\nHosting high-resolution images, 3D models, and interactive elements required significant server space and bandwidth.\nEnsuring long-term accessibility of digital content in rapidly evolving technological environments was a concern.\nThe software used to create the 3D models might become obsolete.\n\nData Management and Metadata:\n\nCreating consistent and comprehensive metadata for diverse digital objects was time-consuming and required specialised knowledge.\nEnsuring interoperability with existing digital archives and repositories was crucial for discoverability.\n\nAccessibility and Usability:\n\nDesigning an accessible online exhibition for users with disabilities required careful consideration of web accessibility guidelines (WCAG).\nTranslating the exhibition content into multiple languages to reach a wider audience was a desired but resource-intensive goal.\n\nEthical Considerations:\n\nThe representation of the former workers, and the impact of the industry on the local environment, needed to be handled with sensitivity.\nThe potential for misinterpretation or misuse of historical data was a concern.\n\nNext section: Case study 1: Suggestions for Overcoming Challenges",

    "text": "Case Study 2: Future Coastal Resilience: Adapting to Rising Sea Levels in the UK\nAuthors: Researchers from the Institute for Research, UK\nCommissioning body: The UK Department for Climate Change\n\nOverview\nSummary: A team of researchers from the Institute for Research was commissioned by the UK Department for Climate Change to produce a report titled Climate Resilience in UK Coastal Communities: Policy Recommendations for 2050. The report provided an in-depth analysis of the vulnerability of coastal towns to climate change, integrating meteorological data, economic projections, and social resilience assessments. It offered policy recommendations for infrastructure investment, community engagement strategies, and legislative reforms to mitigate climate risks. The report was submitted to to the Department for Climate Change and subsequently used as a basis for governmental decision-making. While the research team was keen to make the report publicly available, several challenges prevented immediate open access publication.\nIntended Audience: Government policymakers, local authorities and environmental agencies.\nThe report was not suitable for publication as a journal article for the following reasons:\n\nLength and depth: academic journals impose strict word limits, while this government report consisted of over 200 pages of technical analysis, appendices, and policy recommendations.\nAudience and purpose: this report was designed for policymakers and stakeholders rather than for an academic audience, requiring different structuring and language.\nTimeliness of policy recommendations: journals have long peer-review cycles, whereas this government report needed to influence policy in real time.\n\nWhat challenges can you think of in making the report open access? How could these be addressed?"
