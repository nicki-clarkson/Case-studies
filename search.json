    "text": "Case study 1: Challenges to Open Access\nCopyright and Intellectual Property:\n\nMany historical documents and photographs were held in private collections or by local historical societies, requiring complex copyright clearance.\nOral history recordings involved informed consent issues and potential restrictions on public access to sensitive personal information.\n3D reconstructions required attribution to the software used, and the photogrammetry models could contain elements of intellectual property.\n\nTechnical Infrastructure and Sustainability:\n\nHosting high-resolution images, 3D models, and interactive elements required significant server space and bandwidth.\nEnsuring long-term accessibility of digital content in rapidly evolving technological environments was a concern.\nThe software used to create the 3D models might become obsolete.\n\nData Management and Metadata:\n\nCreating consistent and comprehensive metadata for diverse digital objects was time-consuming and required specialised knowledge.\nEnsuring interoperability with existing digital archives and repositories was crucial for discoverability.\n\nAccessibility and Usability:\n\nDesigning an accessible online exhibition for users with disabilities required careful consideration of web accessibility guidelines (WCAG).\nTranslating the exhibition content into multiple languages to reach a wider audience was a desired but resource-intensive goal.\n\nEthical Considerations:\n\nThe representation of the former workers, and the impact of the industry on the local environment, needed to be handled with sensitivity.\nThe potential for misinterpretation or misuse of historical data was a concern."
